# 📑 Technical Specification: Causal Taint & Provenance Bridges

## 1. The Principle of Causal Taint
In the PIC Standard, "Taint" refers to any data originating from an **Untrusted** provenance. 
* **Axiom:** Any plan generated by an LLM that relies *solely* on Tainted data is itself Tainted.
* **The Violation:** Executing a High-Impact Action (Money/Irreversible) using a Tainted plan.

## 2. Provenance Bridging
A "Bridge" is the process of using **Trusted Data** to validate the claims made by **Untrusted Data**.

### The Logic Gate:
If `Plan_Impact` == `High`:
   `Required_Evidence` must have `TrustLevel == TRUSTED`.

**Example:**
- **Untrusted Input:** Email saying "Pay $500 to Vendor X."
- **Trusted Bridge:** A database query proving "Vendor X is a verified partner."
- **Result:** The "Taint" is removed from the Intent, allowing execution.

## 3. Impact Taxonomy
| Class | Description | Requirements |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Read** | Observational data access. | Untrusted allowed. |
| **Money** | Financial movement. | **Trusted Bridge Mandatory.** |
| **Privacy** | PII exposure. | **Trusted Bridge Mandatory.** |
| **Irreversible** | Deleting data / Hard-stops. | **Multi-Source Trusted Mandatory.** |
